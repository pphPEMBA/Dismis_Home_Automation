A Personal Assistant for Linux and MacOS

![Jarvis](http://i.imgur.com/xZ8x9ES.jpg)

Jarvis is a simple personal assistant for Linux and MacOS which works on the terminal. He can talk to you if you enable his voice. He can tell you the weather, he can find restaurants and other places near you. He can do some great stuff for you. Stay updated about [new functionalities](NEW_FUNCTIONALITIES.md).

## Getting Started

In order to start Jarvis just clone the repository and run `./setup.sh`

Run **Jarvis** from anywhere by command `jarvis`

On Mac OS X run `source setup.sh`

On Windows run `setup.bat`

**NOTE: Jarvis is not fully ported to windows yet, and has only basic functionality. Jarvis's output is also a bit messy!**

You can start by typing `help` within the Jarvis command line to check what Jarvis can do for you.
